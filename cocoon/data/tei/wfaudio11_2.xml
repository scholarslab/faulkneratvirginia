					<head>Regional Dialects A</head>
					<u who="WF">I've had no trouble yet when I have been in New England. I would
						have to listen to it and get into the habit of—of remembering to use their
						own terms, their own diction, but there was no difficulty about
						understanding what they meant.</u>
					<u who="ES">Some of—some of us were talking about Thomas Wolfe this morning, and
						we were under the impression—though I don't know if anyone has studied it
						closely—that he's very good at handling New England dialect and New York
						dialect as well as his native southern, so perhaps you could.</u>
					<u who="B">Well, you have dealt with English speech in—in some of your short
						stories and French speech in <hi rend="italic">A Fable</hi>, it seems to
						me.</u>
				</div2>
				<div2 type="dialog" id="wfaudio11_2.2" start="00:01:45.49" end="00:02:25.21">
					<head>Whupped v Whipped</head>
					<u who="ES">I don't mean to be nitpicking. I'm really asking these questions for
						my own information. But another time you have Wash say "whupped" for the—for
						"whipped." Wouldn't the colonel have said "whupped" too? And if so, why did
						you give Wash the spelling—?</u>
					<u who="WF">Probably not. The colonel wouldn't have said "whupped." He—by—by
						nature, he might've—have said "whupped," but he had associated with gentle
						folk and other plantation owners long enough to have said "whipped" without
						knowing he was changing his speech. But Wash would still have said
						"whupped," just like the Negro would say "whupped."</u>

				<div2 type="dialog" id="wfaudio11_2.3" start="00:02:25.74" end="00:02:44.00">
					<head>Gout</head>
					<u who="AH">Mr. Faulkner, what is a "gout"? "A <inaudible/> of mud."
							<unclear>"Or a gout of mud."</unclear></u>
					<u who="WF">Or—or a gob</u>
					<u who="AH">I see. A blob or something of that sort.</u>
					<u who="WF"><inaudible/> yes.</u>
					<u who="AH">Is that used a great deal in Mississippi? It must be, of course.</u>
					<u who="WF">I've—I've heard that in England.</u>
					<u who="AH">Have you?</u>
					<u who="WF">Mmhmm.</u>

					<head>Shegog's Dialect</head>
					<u who="RD">I wondered, Mr. Faulkner, when the Reverend Shegog talks about the
						"whelming <unclear>blood</unclear>," just what that meant.</u>
					<u who="WF">The overwhelming—</u>
					<u who="RD">Overwhelming <unclear>blood</unclear>.</u>
					<u who="B">I think that's one of the most interesting passages from the point of
						view of what happens to speech under the stress of strong emotion. At the
						beginning of his sermon he speaks very properly and with elegant
						enunciation.</u>
					<u who="AH">Then he warms up.</u>
					<u who="B">And at the end, there's an immense difference, I think.</u>
					<u who="RD">I thinki "recollection" becomes "ricklickshun." Is that right Mr.
						Faulkner?</u>
					<u who="WF">Yes.</u>
					<u who="RD">And "brethren and sisteren" becomes "breddren en sistuhn"?</u>
					<u who="WF">That's right.</u>

					<head>Ghy' for Gwine</head>
					<u who="ES">Here's one good pronunciation I'd like to commend Mr. Faulkner for.
						The old colored woman says, "Stop right whar you is. You ain't never crossed
						dese steps whilst the Cunnel's here and you ain't ghy' do hit now." And it's
						spelled G-H-Y-apostrophe. And I've heard that very often. Of course, it's a
						reduced form of <unclear>Gwine</unclear>. "You ain't
							<unclear>gwine</unclear> do it now."</u>

					<head>Close</head>
					<u who="AH">We've enjoyed being with you for the last fifteen minutes for this
						chat. There is much more on the subject that we could say, but our time has
						run out on us again. Joining us around the table today were Mr. Ed
						Stephenson, Mr. Joseph Blotner, and Mr. Robert Davis, and our special guest
						for the program was Mr. William Faulkner. This is Atcheson Hench thanking
						you for joining us—our discussion and inviting you to listen again next week
						at this time for another chat on some interesting aspect of the language we
						speak.</u>

						have said <unclear>"sure"</unclear>.</u>
					<u who="WF">No, he would have said "sure." There would be a little "r."</u>
					<u who="ES">Yeah, a little "r" on the end of it.</u>
					<u who="WF">And with Wash there wouldn't be one.</u>
					<u who="ES">Well I thought that was your point. "Sho" is without the
						<inaudible/> and the Colonel would have said "shore."</u>
					<u who="B">One of the most interesting words I think I found is "sholly." When—I
						notice peace officers very often seem to say that in the books.</u>
